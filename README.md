## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the **MakeMyBooking** application, developed using the Restful ABAP Programming (RAP) model on ABAP Cloud (also known as ABAP Steampunk). This application demonstrates [briefly describe what the application does, e.g., "a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing travel bookings"]. It leverages the standard `/DMO` (Demo) tables for data persistence and showcases best practices for building scalable and maintainable Fiori-enabled applications in the cloud.

## Features

* **[Feature 1]:** E.g., Displaying a list of travels from `/DMO/I_TRAVEL_U`.
* **[Feature 2]:** E.g., Creating new travel bookings.
* **[Feature 3]:** E.g., Updating existing travel details.
* **[Feature 4]:** E.g., Deleting travel entries.
* **[Feature 5]:** E.g., Integrated with Fiori Elements for a modern user experience.
* **[Feature 6]:** E.g., Utilizes managed scenario for simplified development.
* **[Feature 7]:** E.g., Implements custom actions/validations (if any).

## Prerequisites

To set up and run this application, you will need:

* An active **ABAP Cloud** environment (e.g., SAP BTP, ABAP environment trial account or enterprise account).
* **ABAP Development Tools (ADT) for Eclipse** installed and configured for your ABAP Cloud instance.
* Basic understanding of the **Restful ABAP Programming (RAP) model**.
* Familiarity with **Fiori Elements** (optional, but helpful for understanding the UI).

## Architecture

The application follows the standard RAP architecture, consisting of the following key components:

* **Data Model:** Based on the `/DMO` tables (e.g., `/DMO/I_TRAVEL_U`, `/DMO/I_BOOKING_U`, `/DMO/I_CARRIER_U`).
* **Core Data Services (CDS) Views:**
    * **Interface Views:** Define the consumption model for the business objects (e.g., `I_YOUR_TRAVEL`).
    * **Projection Views:** Expose a subset of the interface view fields for UI consumption (e.g., `C_YOUR_TRAVEL`).
* **Behavior Definition (BDEF):** Defines the transactional behavior of the business object (e.g., create, update, delete, actions).
* **Behavior Implementation (BIMP):** Contains the ABAP logic for implementing the defined behavior.
* **Service Definition (SRVD):** Exposes the CDS entities as an OData service.
* **Service Binding (SRVB):** Activates the OData service for consumption.
* **Fiori Elements Application:** A Fiori Elements application (either automatically generated or explicitly developed) consuming the OData service.
